**SpecterSpot** app, developed by DavTheUtz team as part of the **ITFest Adobe Hackathon, October 2024**,  is based on the scenario of a groups of friends at a party in the middle of the forest that has gone wrong.
Spooky things start happening and they allegedly start seeing strange creatures like ghosts, skeletons or vampires. As a solution, **SpecterSpot** provides an interactive map that allows users to report sightings at their current location
in order to warn others.

The app features a **pop-up menu** that allows for selecting one of three types of creatures for reporting. These are **time based entries**, therefore allowing users to check when a sighting happened by tapping the corresponding icon.

This app is developed in **Android Studio** using **Java** and implements the **Google Maps SDK** for Android.
