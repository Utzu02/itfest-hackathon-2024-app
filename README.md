## 🧩 Overview

**SpecterSpot** is a mobile Android application built around a fictional horror scenario:  
A group of friends is partying in the middle of the forest when things take a turn for the worse. Strange and spooky events begin to unfold — ghostly apparitions, skeletons, and vampires start appearing. To stay safe and alert others, users can report these supernatural sightings in real-time.

The app provides an **interactive map** that allows users to pin and view sightings based on their **current location**. Each report includes a **timestamp**, enabling others to know not just where, but also **when** an encounter was reported.
